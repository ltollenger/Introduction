# An Introduction to me

Hello, I'm Liam.  As a data analyst, I work on projects to increase the business capabilities of internal customers, derive insights from data, create API data connections to external sources, and I designed and built a data warehouse trusted to contain clean, ready-to-use tables.  

# My process for data analysis / making data products
For data analytics, I follow iterative PACE (plan, analsis, construct, execute):
<oi>
  <li>Plan: project requirements are gathered.  I talk with internal customers of project deliverables about the motivations behind the project, the "Why" that drove the internal customer(s) to request a report to be made.</li>
  <il>Analsis: conduct exploratory data analysis.  For data products, this means using my knowledge of the busienss to find the data needed for the outlined business capabilities in the project requirments. 
 For a quick analysis to answer a business question, I look for as many insights as are relevant to the requested information.</il>
  <il>Construct: finalize the viualizations of the data product, or pair down insights to a valuable few.</il>
  <il>Execute: present the insights / data product to internal customers, get feedback, and make any changes if necessary</il>
</oi>
